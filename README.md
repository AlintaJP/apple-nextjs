This project is a complete redesign of the Apple website, built using NextJS. It features a functional cart that allows users to add their favorite Apple products. Payments are processed securely through Stripe, and users can authenticate themselves before making a purchase. The website also features a success page that is displayed after a successful transaction, as well as tabs for different categories of Apple products. The content of the website is easily managed through the Sanity CMS. This project provides a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience for Apple fans.
